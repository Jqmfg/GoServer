# GoServer

## Introduction

This is the official repository for my Go HTTP server.
Currently, this project doesn't have an official name (and likely won't for a while), but I will be working on this pretty frequently.
This project is currently one that I have created for myself so that I can learn the Go programming language and how a server works, along with the HTTP standard.
Eventually, I may decide that I should make this into more than just an HTTP server and may implement other types of protocols too.
